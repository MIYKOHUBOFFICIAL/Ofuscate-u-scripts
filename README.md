**Num 1:**
- [Wearedevs](https://wearedevs.net/obfuscator)
It is the easiest obfuscator to use and one of the most widely used.

- [Luafuscator](https://luaobfuscator.com/)
It is one of the safest obfuscators and has the lowest probability of failing to obfuscate.

- [obfus](https://obfus1.ediwor.fr/)
It has a very aesthetically pleasing interface, and due to its infrequent use, it's very difficult for someone to create a bot to deobfuscate it.

- [Arch-Vault V1]()
This is more of an extra tool to protect our scripts to prevent someone from seeing the source or the obfuscated script, but once the script is uploaded, it cannot be deleted. 
- [Arch-Vault V2]()
  Like its predecessor, it serves the same purpose, but now it includes a library to view your uploaded scripts, and you can also obfuscate them directly here with wearedevs or luafuscator on the same page.
